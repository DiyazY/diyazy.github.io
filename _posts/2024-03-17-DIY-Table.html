  If you've ever thought about building your own work desk but didn't know where
  to start, this post is for you<!--more-->. Building your own work desk is a
  great way to save money and get exactly what you want. In this post, I'll show
  you how to build a simple work desk using basic tools and materials. Hence,
  you can customize it to fit your space and style, and the best part is that
  you don't need any special skills or experience to do it. Let's get started!
</p>
<p>
  First, you'll need to gather your materials. You'll need worktop, legs,
  screws, and a drill. You can find these materials at your local hardware store
  or online. My selection is very budget friendly and easy to find in Finland, but you can choose any materials you like. 
  <ul>
    <li>
      Worktop: I chose a 2000mm x 600mm x 26mm glued timber panel acacia oiled from Bauhaus. Cost: 89 EUR.

    <li>
      Legs (2x): I chose a MITTBACK adjustable leg from IKEA. Cost: 40 EUR x 2 = 80 EUR.

      Here I should have chosen a cheaper option, but I liked the design and the adjustable height. Though I could have saved at least 20 EUR by choosing a cheaper option.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

  Once you have your materials, you can start building your work
  desk. The first step is to attach the legs to the worktop. You can do this by
  drilling pilot holes in the worktop and then screwing the legs into place.

  Make sure the legs are evenly spaced and secure.

  Once the legs are attached, you can add any finishing touches you like, such as a coat of paint or
  varnish. And that's it! You now have a beautiful work desk that you built
  yourself.

    I'm very happy with the result. The desk is sturdy, looks great, and fits
    perfectly in my home office. I also saved a lot of money by building it
    myself. Total cost was 169 EUR, which is a great deal for a desk of this 
    I hope this post has inspired you to build your own work desk. It's a fun and
    rewarding project that anyone can do. Happy building!
