If you’ve ever thought about building your own work desk but didn’t know where to start, this post is for you. Building a work desk is a great way <!--more-->to save money and get exactly what you want. In this post, I’ll show you how to build a simple work desk using basic tools and materials. Hence, you can customize it to fit your space and style, and the best part is that you don’t need any special skills or experience to do it. Let’s get&nbsp;started!

> A good desk might be built by a dilettante by simply assembling different parts.

First, you’ll need to gather your materials. You’ll need a worktop, legs, screws, and a drill. You can find these materials at your local hardware store or online. My selection is very budget-friendly and easy to find in Finland, but you can choose any materials you&nbsp;like.

- Worktop: I chose a 2000mm x 600mm x 26mm glued timber panel acacia oiled from [Bauhaus](https://www.bauhaus.fi/). Cost: 89&nbsp;EUR.

_Texture of top_

The appealing part is that you may find a texture that suits best for&nbsp;you.

- Legs (2x): I chose an MITTBACK adjustable leg from [IKEA](https://www.ikea.com/). Cost: 40 EUR x 2 = 80&nbsp;EUR.

Though I should have chosen a cheaper option, I liked the design and the adjustable height. However, I could have saved at least 20 EUR by choosing a cheaper&nbsp;option.

Once you have your materials, you can start building your work desk. The first step is to attach the legs to the worktop. You can do this by marking hole places (pencil can help) and after that drilling pilot holes in the worktop and then screwing the legs into&nbsp;place.

Make sure the legs are evenly spaced and&nbsp;secure.

Once the legs are attached, you can add any finishing touches, such as a coat of paint or varnish. And that’s it! You now have a beautiful work desk that you built yourself. I have done nothing to my&nbsp;worktop.

_Desk_

I’m very happy with the result. The desk is sturdy, looks great, and fits perfectly in my home office. I also saved a lot of money by building it myself. The total cost was 169 EUR, which is a great deal for a desk of&nbsp;this.

I hope this post has inspired you to build your own work desk. It’s a fun and rewarding project that anyone can do. Happy building!
